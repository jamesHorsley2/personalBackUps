JUMP INSTRUCTIONS

	What are jump instructions?? 
		Jump instructions are instructions that 'jump' to a label in you code, basied on a condition in the flags inside of the F register.

		Jump can also be used with out a condition, and that is called a standard jump

		JP Start_Game // Standard jump with no condition
		JP Z, Start_Game // Standard jump with a Zero Flag condition, checks to see if Z flag is Filled, if the z flag is filled it will jump to Start_Game

		Conditions that can be used in the Jump instruction are (C (CARRY FLAG), NC( NO CARRY FLAG), Z (ZERO), and NZ (NOT ZERO))

		Example of Jump instruction in code

		IS_LIVES_ZERO:

		LD HL, Lives  < lives is set to a constant 16-bit address
		LD A, (HL)	< Accumulator gets the value of lives at the memory location
		CP $00 						< CP compares A to the value $00, if it is $00 or 									less, if = 0, z flag set
		JP Z,Some_Other_Label 		< jumps to some other label if z-flag is set
		NOP 						< Cpu wuld contine here if the z flag was 0
